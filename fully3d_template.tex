\section{Introduction}

Things to keep in mind:
\begin{itemize}
\item submission only in pdf format
\item two colum format with font size 11
\item maximum 4 pages
\item in addition: prepare short abstract (max 150 words) 
      to be entered in online submission system!
      This will be used for the program and will not be part of the pdf!
      You do not need to include this short abstract in this pdf.
\end{itemize}

\section{Materials and Methods}

This is how you add references \cite{Deen2019}, \cite{Doe2020}.

% example equation
And this is a dummy equation
\begin{equation}
I_\alpha = \int_0^\alpha f(x) dx
\end{equation}

% example two column figure (use figure instead of figure* for one column figure)
\begin{figure*}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{./fig1.pdf}
  \caption{This a dummy figure to be replaced.}
  \label{fig:dummyfigure}
\end{figure*}

Figure \ref{fig:dummyfigure} shows how to include a figure.
Table \ref{tab:dummytable} shows how to include a table.
